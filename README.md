# metaped_assets_map
At the moment this is a fairly raw dump of the metaped assets, more context on their use is provided by t3chman here:

I have extracted the metaped assets and run a tool to categorize the associated albedo, normal, material from the matchtag references and then output lua compatible tables with the data.
